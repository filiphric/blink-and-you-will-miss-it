<!-- 
- show code, then go to demo
- we see the error message, but we donâ€™t see what exactly is coing on
- the nature of Cypress commands is that they sometimes hide what is going on behind
- but we can actually see those violations
- search elements
- search react components
- compare to passing test - code was not ran at all

# False positive flake

```js {*|8}
beforeEach(() => {
  cy.visit('/');
  cy.contains('Loading').should('not.exist');

});

it('Checks accessibility of a page', () => {
  cy.get('.modal').should('be.visible')

<!-- 
- the problem now is, that we did not make sure that application is ready for accessibility check
- [click] we need to make sure by check the modal presence first
